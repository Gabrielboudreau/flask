## [Flask Portfolio Starter (from which we are referencing for our own project)](https://nighthawkcodingsociety.com/projectsearch/details/Flask%20Portfolio%20Starter)
Runtime link: https://portfolio.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/

### Idea
* Create an effective website for the Womenâ€™s Health Awareness (WHA) club at DNHS to allow greater club outreach.

### Visual Thoughts
* Clean, minimalistic, and navigable (reference UX design principles)
* Organized color palette that matches WHA logo
* Add extra interaction and movement with Bootstrap (e.g. carousel, animated buttons)
* Show project-specific links (hrefs) per page

### Technical Elements
* Give users positive first impression through homepage (images, mission statement, new/events board)
* Give uses ample amount of information on the club
* Create useful and clean sign-up page (reference UX design principles; make sure the sign-up is not overwhelming to look at)
* Link social media (Instagram, Twitter)

### Implementation progress (August 18th, 2021)
#### As of for now, we have our flask project open on IltelliJ, and manipulated the code to match the general layout we plan on using for our website. Some of these changes include:
* Customization changes (e.g. changing the name of the website from "Nighthawk Coding Society" to "DNHS Women's Health Awareness")
* Editing the names of the different tabs on navbar.html to "Home", "About", "Outreach", "Sign Up" (with the exception of our mini-lab pages at the end)
